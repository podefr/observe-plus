Observe+

Observe+ is a library based on [Object.observe](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe) that adds the following features:

- pause/resume to do bach updates on the model before publishing all the events
- fine grained observe on individual properties
- observe once to remove the observe after an event has fired.
